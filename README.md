# The Underworld Journey - Interactive Date Proposal

An interactive web experience inspired by Greek mythology and personal interests, created as a unique way to ask someone special on a date.

## Concept

"The Underworld Journey" is a Greek mythology-inspired interactive journey where the user navigates through a stylized "underworld" to discover a date proposal. The experience incorporates elements of mystery and personal interests including:

- Green tea (slightly chilled)
- Dark chocolates
- Dancing and writing
- Favorite colors: purple, yellow, and orange
- Greek mythology (specifically Hades)

## User Experience

The journey takes the user through multiple themed "realms" representing different interests:
1. **The Tea Gardens** - A serene space with interactive tea elements
2. **The Writer's Sanctuary** - A place of creativity and expression
3. **The Dance Hall** - An elegant space with musical elements
4. **The Chocolate River** - A rich, indulgent environment
5. **The Heart of the Underworld** - The final destination with the complete message
